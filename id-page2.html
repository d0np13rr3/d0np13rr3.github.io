      <p>Electricity appears to be the better choice, it's even cheaper when you produce it yourself. On the other hand we know that countries still produce electricity by burning coal. It isn't the best choice, yet.<br>
        Fuel varies from region to region, since it pollutes it isn't our first choice anymore. But it is still the primary mode of powering our cars. There are companies that capture CO2 but not nearly enough to capture what is being produced daily.<br>
        Hydrogen exists but the prices listed here are market prices, sometimes I couldn't even find prices at the pump. As the resource is infinite it could be a potential winner but it isn't ready for large scale production. <br><br>
        Electric cars are expensive, hydrogen isn't as cheap as it should be and tanking fuel will stop. If you like it or not. As of this moment there are to many uncertainties to pick a mode of powering your car that will stay for the next 100 years.<br><br>
        Some car manufacters made their bet on electricity others still bet on hydrogen. I for one still dream of cars with ion thrusters. Only time will tell.
