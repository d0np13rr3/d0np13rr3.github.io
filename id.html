    <h1>Who is Pieter Pauwels? And why is he named Pierre?</h1>
    <p><em>Pieter Pauwels is a man, born in Wetteren on the 8th of July in 1983.</em> As a young man always interested in everything
      that connected he started building and hasn't stopped since. If it wasn't machines that were aligned to produce
      marshmallows, it was invoices he booked to make sure both sides of the bookkeeping checked out. But in the background
      there was a fire burning. Automating stuff with Excel to predict when the last batch of marshmallows could be started
      or making macro's to produce XML files. Every chance he got to build things in programming he took. And just now he
      began a course in Java. The adventure continues! </p>
    <p>But the question on everybody's lips: Why is he called Pierre? It all goes back to a lesson back in fifth grade.
      In a paper written for French class he had correctly translated the name Pieter to Pierre. The teacher not expecting
      this had laughed aloud and told this to the whole class. His fellow students picked it up and from then on the name stuck. </p>

    <h2>What's up with fuel consumption these days?</h2>
    <p><em>Back in the day all we had to do is fill our car with gasoline and we could drive.</em> What is the best way to power
      our cars? This day and age we have cars on hydrogen, fuel, electricity or a combination of these elements.
      Price of these forms of power change every day and we don't know for sure what resource will be available today. Or
      what will be available within 50 days, months or years. With this question on everbody's mind, agreed there is a
      difference in what governments, industry or people question, everybody wants what best and sustainable. There are however
      a number of problems when trying to solve this question.
    <p>Corporate greed is what got us into this mess so we don't have much to expect from the existing dinosaur companies who
      provide us with oil and gas. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/">
      Exxon</a> only being one example of this. This greed concerning oil reached its pinnacle when it was used
      <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/report/kremlins-gas-wars">in war like Russia does.</a>
    <p>There are however a number of new industries who tackle the problems created by fuel consumption and who contemplate knew
      sources of energy to power our cars. Electricity being most favorable at the moment, we also have hydrogen and even
      <a href="https://www.solutionair.nl/en/">pressurized air</a> to count amongst the options. In a tipping of history as we
      are now it is hard to predict what will win. My money is on electricity but there are other forms that
      are so obscure but have so much potential that my bet still isn't secure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster">Ion
      thrusters</a> being one of them. But that could easily be lightyears away.</p>
    <h2>The decision isn't about what but also where.</h2>
      <em>In my opinion this question about what is the best way to power our cars isn't only about what technology to use.</em> It's also
      where do I want to power my car. Let me clarify this reasoning. Not only is the number of Dodge RAM's in New Delhi
      rather small I doubt you will find a lot of bikes in the outskirts of Texas. There a number of techologies booming and places with a lot
      of sun will have it easy to produce electricity. Where more advanced regions probably will get easy acces to hydrogen fuel.
      In a study that has yet to be performed we would like to see which kind of vehicle is suited for which kind of environment.
      Places like Dubai will choose classic fuel. They are sitting on it. Africa on the other hand has so much sun, electricity
      should be the obvious choice. But these statements are ramblings from one man on the internet. A study should enlighten us
      more. Time we did a little research ourselves. <a href="id-page2.html">You can find out all about it here.</a></p>
